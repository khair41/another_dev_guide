## üéØ Core Concept

*   **What is it?** The Two Pointers technique is a simple and highly effective pattern for optimizing problems that involve searching for pairs or sub-arrays in a sorted array. Instead of using a slow nested loop (O(n¬≤)), we use two iterators (pointers) that move through the array in a coordinated way, allowing us to solve the problem in a single pass.

*   **Why is it useful?** Its primary benefit is performance. It typically reduces the time complexity from **O(n¬≤)** down to **O(n)**. Furthermore, because it modifies pointers in-place, it often achieves this with **O(1)** extra space, making it very efficient.

## ü§î When to Use This Pattern

Look for these key indicators in a problem description:

*   The input is a **sorted array** (or can be sorted easily).
*   You need to find a **pair, triplet, or sub-array** that satisfies a certain condition (e.g., sums up to a target).
*   The problem involves comparing elements from **opposite ends** of an array.
*   You need to process an array in a way that avoids creating temporary data structures.
*   The problem asks for a solution with **O(1) space complexity**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Common Patterns & Variations

### 1. Opposite Ends Pattern

*   **Description**: This is the most common variation. One pointer (`left`) starts at the beginning of the array, and the other (`right`) starts at the end. They move towards each other until they meet or cross.
*   **Best for**: Problems on **sorted arrays** where you're looking for a pair that meets a specific condition. The sorted nature of the array allows you to make intelligent decisions about which pointer to move.
*   **Used in**: `Two Sum II`, `3Sum`, `Container With Most Water`.

### 2. Same Direction (Fast/Slow) Pattern

*   **Description**: Two pointers (often called `slow` and `fast`) start at or near the beginning of the array. The `fast` pointer moves ahead to explore the array, while the `slow` pointer only advances when a certain condition is met. This pattern is often used for in-place modifications.
*   **Best for**: Problems like "Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array" or cycle detection in linked lists.
