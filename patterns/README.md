# Algorithmic Patterns

This directory contains a library of clean, commented code templates for common algorithmic patterns. The goal is to provide a focused, reusable skeleton for each pattern to aid in memorization and practice.

### Two Pointers

*   **[Opposite Ends](./two_pointers/OppositeEnds.java)**
    *   *A template for the classic pattern where pointers start at opposite ends of a sorted array and move towards each other. Ideal for finding pairs that meet a certain condition.*

*   **[Same Direction (Fast/Slow)](./two_pointers/SameDirection.java)**
    *   *A template for the pattern where two pointers move in the same direction at different speeds. Ideal for in-place array modifications, like removing duplicates.*


*More patterns will be added here as the playbook grows.*
