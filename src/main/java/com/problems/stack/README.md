## ðŸŽ¯ Core Concept: The Power of LIFO

A Stack is a data structure that follows the **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)** principle. The last element you add is the first one you can access or remove. Think of it like a stack of plates or a browser's back button history.

This LIFO property is not just a limitation; it's a powerful feature. It gives us a way to "remember" a history of states and reverse back through them. The ability to only process the "head" or `top` of the stack is what makes it perfect for problems involving nested structures, backtracking, or, as we will see, managing and restoring state.
