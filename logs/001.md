# Log 001: Project Initialization & Git Setup

### Summary

This session focused on the initial setup of the Java Problem-Solving Playbook.

**Key Accomplishments:**
*   **Project Scaffolding**: Created the initial project structure, including a `.gitignore` file to exclude compiled files and IDE settings, and a root `README.md` to define the project's purpose.
*   **Git Synchronization**: Resolved common initial Git setup issues, including renaming the local `master` branch to `main` to match GitHub's default and merging unrelated histories to align the local and remote repositories.
