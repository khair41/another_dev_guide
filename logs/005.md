# Log 005: Completing the Two Pointers Section & Creating the Patterns Library

### Summary

This session focused on completing a new major topic, "Two Pointers," and refactoring the project to create a clear distinction between data structures and algorithmic patterns.

**Key Accomplishments:**

1.  **Completed "Two Pointers" Topic**:
    *   Implemented and added comprehensive test cases for a full suite of classic problems: `Valid Palindrome`, `Two Sum II`, `3Sum`, `Container With Most Water`, and `Trapping Rain Water`.
    *   Explored multiple solution approaches for several problems (e.g., Two Pointers vs. HashMap for `3Sum`; four distinct solutions for `Trapping Rain Water`) to analyze their trade-offs.

2.  **Created the `patterns` Directory**:
    *   Refactored the project to create a new top-level `/patterns` directory, designed to hold a library of clean, reusable code templates for common algorithmic patterns.
    *   Created Java code templates for the **Opposite Ends** and **Same Direction (Fast/Slow)** variations of the Two Pointers pattern.

3.  **Enhanced Documentation**:
    *   Created a comprehensive `README.md` for the Two Pointers pattern, including links to all solved problems and their specific solutions.
    *   Updated the main project `README.md` to reflect the new, more organized structure distinguishing between `data_structures` and `patterns`.
