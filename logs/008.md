# Log 008: Building Out the Binary Search Section

### Summary

This session was dedicated to establishing a new major topic: Binary Search. We created a comprehensive set of problems that explore the core algorithm as well as its more advanced applications and variations.

**Key Accomplishments:**

1.  **Initialized "Binary Search" Topic**:
    *   Created a new `com.problems.binary_search` package.
    *   Created a comprehensive `README.md` for the topic, which details the standard binary search template, the importance of boundary conditions to prevent infinite loops, and an introduction to the powerful "Binary Search on the Answer" pattern.

2.  **Created a Wide Range of Problem Templates**:
    *   **`BinarySearchProblem`**: The classic implementation.
    *   **`SearchA2DMatrixProblem`**: Applying binary search to a "virtual" 1D array.
    *   **`KokoEatingBananasProblem`**: A perfect example of the "Binary Search on the Answer" pattern.
    *   **`SearchInRotatedSortedArrayProblem`**: A medium-difficulty problem requiring modified boundary logic.
    *   **`FindMinimumInRotatedSortedArrayProblem`**: A variation on searching a rotated array.
    *   **`TimeBasedKeyValueStoreProblem`**: A design problem combining a `HashMap` with `Binary Search`.
    *   **`MedianOfTwoSortedArraysProblem`**: A hard problem requiring an advanced understanding of binary search on partitions.

3.  **Enhanced Data Structure Documentation**:
    *   Updated the `data_structures/trees/README.md` to include the `O(log N)` time complexities for the key methods of `TreeMap` and `TreeSet`, clarifying their connection to binary search principles.

**Next Steps**: Implement the solutions for the newly created binary search problem templates, or begin the next topic section.
