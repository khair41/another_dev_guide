# Log 006: Kicking Off the Stack Section

### Summary

This session focused on beginning the next major topic in the playbook: the Stack. We set up the necessary files and explored two classic stack problems, including a deep dive into multiple implementation strategies for each.

**Key Accomplishments:**

1.  **Initialized "Stack" Topic**:
    *   Created a new `com.problems.stack` package to house all problems related to this data structure.
    *   Created a placeholder `README.md` for the topic, which will be filled out as more problems are solved.

2.  **Implemented "Valid Parentheses"**:
    *   Created the problem and solution template for this quintessential stack problem, which is a perfect introduction to LIFO principles.

3.  **Deep Dive on "Min Stack"**:
    *   Created the problem template for this classic design problem.
    *   Explored and created solution templates for **three distinct approaches**: the standard two-stack solution, a single stack with pairs (`int[]`), and the highly optimized single stack with a variable (differential encoding).
    *   Documented the advanced state management and differential encoding patterns in a dedicated `deep_dive/README.md` to capture the complex logic.

4.  **Explored "Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation"**:
    *   Created the problem template for another classic stack use case.
    *   Set up solution templates for three different ways to think about the problem: a standard `Stack`, a `LinkedList` acting as a stack, and a `Recursive` solution that uses the program's call stack.

**Next Steps**: Continue with the remaining problems in the Stack section and then build out the main `README.md` for the topic.
