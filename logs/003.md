# Log 003: Standardizing Documentation & Starting First Topic

### Summary

This session marked the transition from high-level planning to concrete implementation. The focus was on creating a standardized documentation template and beginning the first problem-solving topic.

**Key Accomplishments:**
*   **Documentation Template**: Created the `README.template` file. This establishes a standard, reusable format for all future topic study guides, ensuring consistency.
*   **Began "Arrays & Hashing"**: Kicked off the work on the first official topic, "Arrays & Hashing," by setting up its package and starting to implement the initial problems.
