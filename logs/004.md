# Log 004: Framework Enhancements & Topic Completion

### Summary

This session focused on adding major new features to the testing framework to improve workflow and on completing the first major topic section.

**Key Accomplishments:**
*   **"Run All" Feature**: Implemented the capability to run the test suites for all registered problems with a single `all` command.
*   **Expanded Test Coverage**: Increased the number of test cases for all problems within the `Arrays & Hashing` topic, focusing on edge cases.
*   **Problem Exclusion**: Added an `@ExcludeFromRegistry` annotation, allowing work-in-progress problems to be cleanly excluded from the framework.
*   **Topic Completion**: Finalized the initial version of the "Arrays & Hashing" study guide and its associated problems.
