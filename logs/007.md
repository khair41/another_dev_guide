# Log 007: Completing the Stack Section

### Summary

This session was dedicated to building out the "Stack" topic, which involved not only solving a wide range of classic problems but also performing deep dives into the underlying patterns and advanced implementation techniques.

**Key Accomplishments:**

1.  **Completed "Stack" Problem Set**:
    *   Implemented templates for a full suite of stack-related problems, from easy to hard: `Valid Parentheses`, `Min Stack`, `Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation`, `Generate Parentheses`, `Daily Temperatures`, `Car Fleet`, and `Largest Rectangle in Histogram`.
    *   For many problems, we created templates for **multiple distinct solutions** (e.g., Stack vs. Recursion vs. DP) to facilitate a deeper comparison of algorithmic trade-offs.

2.  **Deep Dive on Advanced Concepts**:
    *   Performed a detailed analysis of the **`Min Stack`** problem, creating a dedicated `deep_dive` document to explain the advanced **State Encoding / Differential Encoding** pattern.
    *   Created a similar deep dive for the **`Car Fleet`** problem, with visual diagrams to explain the stack's state and the logic of fleet formation.

3.  **Created a Recursion Guide**:
    *   Based on the "Generate Parentheses" problem, we created a comprehensive guide to recursive thinking (`Recursive_Thinking_Guide.md`) in the `/patterns` directory. This guide covers the core components of recursion, state management (call stack vs. global variables), and includes a decision tree to visualize the backtracking process.

4.  **Finalized Topic Documentation**:
    *   Created a comprehensive `README.md` for the `stack` package. This guide defines the core LIFO concept, details the common stack patterns (Basic, Monotonic, State Encoding), and provides a full, hyperlinked checklist of all solved problems and their specific solution files.
