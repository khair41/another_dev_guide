Skills that I need to practice

## Generate different valid inputs

## Simplify Trie generation methods

## Practice how to abstract graph problems (state/search)

## Quickly generate decision trees
    This will help to see the recursion or repeated work better

    This should also help to find the subproblem

    Cleary define the subproblem in the decision tree

    Found in DP problem Word Break while trying to  see the repeated work


### Realizations:
    When looking at DP problems and splitting in brute force, I started noticing why different configurations can actually
    create the repeated work.

    i.e. substrings

    original word: racecar
    possible splits: [r, acecar] [race, car]

    when looking at 'acecar' you will eventually reach 'car' that's when you find the repeated work, hence I can store
    the solution if we encounter before

## Function design
    Before writing a helper function is there a better way to determine the function i need to create?

## Manhattan distance
    Should be able to calculate the distances between 2 points

    This should help for Math formulas when calculating areas of figures


Memorize
# Kadane's
    - Remember that the curr number can be a possible solution and the start of a seq with solution

# Longest Increasing Subsequence

# Linked List Operations
    - Reverse (iterative / recursive)

# LRU
