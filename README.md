# My Java Problem-Solving Playbook

This repository is my personal library for learning and mastering algorithms and data structures. It's organized as a collection of topic-specific "plays" or modules, where each module is a deep dive into a single concept.

## The Philosophy

*   **Learn by Pattern, Not by Problem:** The goal isn't just to collect solutions, but to understand the underlying *patterns* (like backtracking, sliding window, etc.) that solve entire classes of problems.
*   **Each Topic is a Module:** Every major topic gets its own dedicated folder. This folder acts as a self-contained learning module, complete with its own notes, templates, and code examples.
*   **Notes First, Code Second:** Each module will have its own `README.md` that explains the "What, Why, and How" of the pattern. The code is there to support the notes, not the other way around.

## How It's Organized

The project is structured into directories, where each directory represents a core topic. Inside each directory, you'll find:

1.  A `README.md` file explaining the pattern, its use cases, trade-offs, and common pitfalls.
2.  A `template.java` file that provides a reusable, well-commented skeleton for solving problems of that type.
3.  Individual Java files, each being a clean, runnable solution to a specific problem using that pattern.

## Topics Covered

This library will be organized into the following modules:

*   Recursion & Backtracking
*   Arrays & Hashing
*   Two Pointers & Sliding Window
*   Stack
*   Binary Search
*   Linked Lists
*   Trees & Tries
*   Heaps / Priority Queues
*   Graphs
*   Dynamic Programming (1D & 2D)

## Future Roadmap / TODO

- [ ] Create a new folder structure that aims to practice by problem types.
- [ ] Reorganize existing problems into their respective topic folders.
