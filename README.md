# Just Another Dev Guide

This repository is my personal collection of solved coding problems in Java. It serves as my go-to reference for algorithms, data structures, and common interview questions that I have worked through.

## Project Philosophy

*   **Standalone Solutions**: Each Java file is designed to be a self-contained solution to a specific problem.
*   **Runnable Examples**: Most files include a `main` method that demonstrates the solution with a sample input, making it easy to run and verify the logic.
*   **Focus on Clarity**: The code is written to be clear and understandable, serving as a good reference for future review.

## How to Use

The easiest way to use this repository is to open it in a Java-compatible IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code).

From there, you can open any individual Java file and run its `main` method to see the solution in action.

## Current Problems in the Library

This project includes, but is not limited to, implementations for:

*   **Recursion Practice:**
    *   Sum of an array
    *   String reversal
    *   Palindrome checking
    *   Decimal to binary conversion
    *   Power function
    *   Sorting a queue recursively
    *   Generating all subsets of a set

*   **Searching & Sorting:**
    *   Binary Search
    *   Sorting a Queue

*   **Data Structures & Algorithms:**
    *   Fibonacci Sequence
    *   Anagram Checking
    *   Product Sum
    *   Spiral Traversal of a Matrix
    *   Finding the Closest Value in a Binary Search Tree (BST)
    *   Validating a Subsequence
    *   Finding the Smallest Difference between two arrays
